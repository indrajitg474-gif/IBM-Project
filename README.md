#üõ£Ô∏è Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects

üìú Project Overview
This project automates the classification of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) rural infrastructure projects into their respective schemes (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc.) using Machine Learning.

The PMGSY program provides all-weather road connectivity to unconnected rural habitations across India.
Manual categorization of thousands of road and bridge projects is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

We developed a multi-class classification ML model that predicts the correct PMGSY scheme based on the physical and financial characteristics of each project.

üéØ Objectives

Automate classification of road/bridge projects into correct PMGSY scheme.

Improve monitoring, budgeting, and transparency in rural development.

Minimize manual errors and reduce time spent in project verification.

Deploy the model on IBM Cloud Lite services for scalability.
